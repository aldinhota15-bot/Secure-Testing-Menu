- THIS IS THE WORK OF 1 WEEK OF LEARNING PYTHON BY MYSELF:

I've decided to learn Python as the first step in pursuing my career choice in Computer Hardware Engineering and Data Science.
This is all subject to change and could eventually become something even better than a testing environment for learning new 
skills in Python. As stated: THIS IS A TESTING ENVIRONMENT BUT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

NOTE: I might leave new notes from time to time to include things i've learned so far and to store core concepts.

WEEK 1:

- Started off as a basic interactive menu using if/else statements
- Added loops and dictonaries to store text
- Added lists to store the menu, user input, and passwords(Yes I added passwords and retry attempts)
- Also used checks such as try/except to check for invalid inputs
- later refined this to combine the lists into a set that stores each option and its password
- Used the set to combine the dictonaries into one
